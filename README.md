What the Chatbot Does ‚úÖ:

The chatbot will introduce itself to the users. the user can either ask the chatbot there for help, or they can select the navigate button on the top to open different pages, such as task assistant, quiz page, or the activity log. 
When selecting the task page, the user will enter the information needed (with or without a reminder) and the assistant will save it. Then there is a close button to go back to the home page.
When selecting the quiz page, it will open the starting page of the quiz, which will say start quiz or close (which leads back to the home page). When selecting start, the quiz will begin, displaying questions and the inputs to choose from, and then the user will select submit answer, and the quiz will say whether or not it is the correct answer.
The last page of the quiz will show the total score, any tip they may need, depending on the score, and a close button to go to the home page.
When selecting the activity log, the system will show the log of all activity done, and the user can select any and decide to either mark as done or delete the activity. There is also a close button here for the gooing to the home page.
When on the home page, the user, as said before, can ask for help, or they can ask the chatbot questions about cybersecurity and the bot will give them an answer.
